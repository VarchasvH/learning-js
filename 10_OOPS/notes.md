# JS and Classes
JavaScript's classes are syntactical sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance. 

They provide a more convenient and readable way to create and work with constructor functions and prototypes.

## OOPS - Programming Paradigm
#### Object - Collection of properties and methods

### Why?
The code was starting to get messy - Spaghetti Code and to use some good services from java or other languages.

### Parts of OOP
- Object literal
- Constructor function.
- Prototypes
- Classes.
- Instances(new, this).

### Four Pillars of OOPS
1. **Abstraction** - Hide details. Eg - Fetch()
2. **Inheritance** - Use properties of another class.
3. **Encapsulation** - Create a wrapper around code.
4. **Polymorphism** - One method can do many things.
